### **ABOUT**

Factions Mod is an ultra lightweight, fast, and elegant solution to factions in modern minecraft. The **server-side** mod expands upon all the classic factions features whilst also focusing on customization and performance. Grow your faction, expand your claims, and storm your enemies for their chunks and loot.

A faction's power cap increases as new members join, expanding their ability to claim more land. For each claim they make, it requires that faction to sustain more power. Dying to other players will temporarily lose faction power and if it drops below the required threshold, all their claims will be vulnerable to being overtaken.
